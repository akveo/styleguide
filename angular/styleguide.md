# Angular projects guidance.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions all the developers must follow.

## Style guide

As a styleguide we must follow generic approaches described by Angular team. [This document](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) presents preferred conventions and, as importantly, explains why.

[The Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) is a command-line interface tool that must be used to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell.

We must use [ESLint](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) to enable linting for Angular projects according to styleguides.

Set up linting rules based on [angular.eslintrc](./angular.eslintrc) config.
